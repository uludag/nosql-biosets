# Project aim and summary

NoSQL-biosets project includes scripts for indexing and querying
selected free bioinformatics datasets.

Elasticsearch and MongoDB are two databases
supported for most datasets included in the project.
Neo4j and PostgreSQL support was implemented as the third database option
for few datasets, namely for IntEnz, PubTator and HGNC.

## Datasets supported

Datasets that had more attention and have more stable support:

  _at its early stages of development_ 
  (_KEGG data distribution policy lets us think twice when spending
   time on KEGG data_)

Project aims to connect above datasets by implementing query APIs
for common query patterns with individual and multiple indexes.
It also includes initial work on returning query results of IntEnz, DrugBank, HMDB,
ModelSEEDdb, and MetaNetX datasets as graphs.

A sister [project](https://github.com/uludag/hspsdb-indexer)
aims to develop index scripts for sequence
similarity search results, either in NCBI-BLAST json format
or in BLAST tabular format which is used by other search programs as well,
such as [LAMBDA](https://github.com/seqan/lambda) and
[DIAMOND](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond).
HSPsDB project aims to link the indexed search results
to the datasets indexed with this project, nosqlbiosets.

## Installation

Download nosqlbiosets project source code and install required libraries:

```bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/hspsdb/nosql-biosets.git
cd nosql-biosets
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
```

Project could be installed
using the `setup.py` `develop` and `--user` options
that should allow running the index scripts from project
source folders:

```bash
python setup.py develop --user
```

Default values of the hostname and port numbers of Elasticsearch and MongoDB servers
are read from [`./conf/dbservers.json`](conf/dbservers.json) file.
Save your settings in this file to avoid entering `--host` and `--port`
parameters in command line.

## Usage

Example command lines for downloading UniProt Knowledgebase Swiss-Prot data set
(~690M) and for indexing:

```bash
$ wget ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/\
knowledgebase/complete/uniprot_sprot.xml.gz
```

Make sure your Elasticsearch server is running in your localhost.
If you are new to Elasticsearch and  you are using Linux
the easiest way is to [download Elasticsearch](
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) with the TAR option (~32M).
After extracting the tar file `cd` to your Elasticsearch folder
and run `./bin/elasticsearch` command.

Downloaded UniProt xml file can be indexed by running the following command
from nosqlbiosets project root folder,
typically requires 2 to 8 hours with Elasticsearch,
and between 1 and 5 hours with MongoDB

```bash
./nosqlbiosets/uniprot/index.py ./uniprot_sprot.xml.gz\
   --host localhost --db Elasticsearch --index uniprot
```

Example query: list most mentioned gene names

```bash
curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/uniprot/_search?pretty=true"\
 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "genes": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "gene.name.#text.keyword",
        "size": 5
      },
      "aggs": {
        "tids": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "gene.name.type.keyword",
            "size": 5
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Check [`./tests/test_uniprot_queries.py`](tests/test_uniprot_queries.py)
and [`./nosqlbiosets/uniprot/query.py`](./nosqlbiosets/uniprot/query.py) for
example queries with Elasticsearch and MongoDB.

## Similar Work

* [https://github.com/daler/gffutils](https://github.com/daler/gffutils):
  "GFF and GTF files are loaded into SQLite3 databases,
  allowing much more complex manipulation of hierarchical features
  (e.g., genes, transcripts, and exons) than is possible with plain-text methods
  alone"
  
    _We are inspired by the gffutils project. Needless to say, nosql-biosets
    project doesn't yet have a level of maturity comparable to the gffutils library_.
